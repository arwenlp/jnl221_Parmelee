			<h2> The Rate of Homelessness Climbs in Florida. </h2>
			<h4> Natural Displacement Numbers Are Climbing Yearly.</h4>

			<h3>A Harrowing Reality</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->
			<p>The U.S. Census Bureau released a Household Pulse Survey of data collected from 2020-2023. The survey revealed  a striking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/climate/climate-disasters-survivors-displacement.html?auth=login-google1tap&login=google1tap" target="_blank"> 2.5 million people </a> were forced from their homes in the united States by weather-related disasters in 2023. This number in the year prior was 3.3 million. <br>

			<br>This alarming statistic has the largest impact in Florida, where the most reported cases of displacement occurred. The most reported disaster being hurricanes, and another statistic collected were the amount of people displaced a month prior to a natural disaster.  <br> </p>

			<p> <br> Gigi Ibrahim, a resident of Treasure Island Florida, has spent many volunteering hours at a homeless shelter. She recalls a time during her time working at the shelter after hurricane Ian in 2022.<br>

			<br> “A few months after hurricane Ian, I was helping out at a homeless shelter through my church, and the number of homeless people was nothing like i’ve ever seen before.” <br>

			<br> The data shows the amount of homelessness peaked around the natural disaster in not only Florida but California, Texas, Louisiana, and New York. Not only was homelessness at the time of a natural disaster reported, but also homelessness a month prior to any natural disasters was collected in the survey as well.  <br>

			<br> In addition to domestic devastation from these disasters, economic losses from in the past five years are at an <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/more-3-million-americans-were-displaced-natural-disaster-past-year-how-can-we-prepare" target="_blank">averaged more than $150 billion annually,</a> according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.<br></p>

			<h3>Child Poverty Surges</h3>
			<p>With the rise in homelessness comes household instability, the most tragic area being the inability to provide and care for children. <br>

			<br> Some areas of child poverty examined in the survey such as adults in households where there was not enough food to feed their children in the last seven days, children under five years of age being unable to attend daycare, number of children recieving food assistance, and adults recieving child credit on their taxes. <br>

			<br> Dr. Rumbach, who holds a Ph.D. in city and regional planning and is a senior fellow at the nonprofit group  <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/more-3-million-americans-were-displaced-natural-disaster-past-year-how-can-we-prepare" target="_blank">The Urban Institute</a>, said this about the collections that dataset was able to captured. <br>

			<br> “A lot of people's lives are disrupted by these events in small and large ways,” said Rumbach. "It has a really big cumulative cost that's hard to caputre. This, at least, gives us a snapshot of that."<br></p>

			<iframe title="Child Poverty and Displacement" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-fEViP" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fEViP/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 10px; min-width: 90% !important; border: none;" height="311" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

			<p><br> In terms of percentage (shown in graph) from 2021 to 2023, each area saw a very dangerous increase. Child food assistance skyrocketed by a staggering 988.06% This indicates the need for immediate help amidst this crisis.  <br>

			<br> The need for immediate attention to these issues. The vast spike in child food asmsistence speaks volumes and calls for the need to protect the most vulnerable members of our society.  <br>

			<br> Out of all fifty states, Florida has the highest increase in child poverty, seen from 2022 to 2023. This survey in income and poverty showed the child poverty rate <a href="https://cssp.org/2023/09/child-poverty-doubled-last-year-we-owe-children-so-much-more/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw3NyxBhBmEiwAyofDYc1Xiqo7-24lCOUlHt2UOjUTxiqjy9U78cengFTxs_CWtETK1jYtARoCyasQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">doubled from 5.2 percent in 2021 to 12.4%.</a> <br></p>

			<h3>How The Future Looks for America's Displaced Population</h3>
			<p>There is a variety of solutions to lessening the damage sone to human life because of natural disasters. Some solutions include the government taking extra preventitive measures in areas heavily impacted, inputting special construction laws when buildings are being built so they can withstand the magnitude of severe weather, creating additional housing assistance and support services when responding the disasters, and much more.  <br>  

			<br> Organizations such as The Salvation Army, The Red Cross and other homeless shelters should be adequatley prepared weeks in advance to respond to the fallout from these disasters.  <br> 

			<br> Addressing some systemic inequities such as discrimination on the basis of race, gender, housing segregation, income inequality, and the impacts all of these factors have within merginalized communities. Fostering a sense of belonging and priority for these groups of people to get help when in need are all measures that should be taken. <br> 

			<br> Child poverty due to many displacement factors needs to be handles in another way. Social safety nets should be put in place, creating programs that strategize methods of reducing child poverty like provising food assistance, healthcare coverage for people of all ages, and childcare subsidies. <br>

			<br> Children living in single-parent, impoverished households all over the countries, and communities of color are vulerable areas that need programs such as these.<br> 

			<br> Another solution to aiding the impact of child poverty, the Government should invest more money into education systems, and provide income support. Making education more accessable to low-income families, while emphasizing the importance of education will help break cycles of poverty. Meanwhile providing income support to the adults of these families by implementing policies the give direct income support can help families meet basic needs and reduce financial stress.<br> 

			<br> Elizabeth Fussell, a professor of population studies at Brown University was quoted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/climate/climate-disasters-survivors-displacement.html?auth=login-google1tap&login=google1tap" target="_blank">in the New York Times article about the FCB's Survey</a> saying The concepts themselves- What is a disaster? What is displacement?- are really left open to the interpretation of the survey respondent."
